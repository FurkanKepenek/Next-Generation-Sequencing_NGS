## Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) Analysis

This repository contains code for processing and analyzing Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. If you're working with NGS data on a Linux system and want to share your code on GitHub, follow the steps outlined below.

### Linux Commands:

To work with NGS data on Linux, you'll need to familiarize yourself with essential Linux commands. Here are some sample commands and explanations:

1. **Navigate to the Data Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/data
   ```
   Change the current directory to the location where your NGS data is stored.

2. **List Files:**
   ```bash
   ls
   ```
   View the list of files in the current directory.

3. **View Data Files:**
   ```bash
   cat your_file.fastq
   ```
   View the contents of a FASTQ data file.

4. **Perform Data Analysis (e.g., Aligning with BWA):**
   ```bash
   bwa mem reference.fasta sample.fastq > aligned.sam
   ```
   Use BWA for aligning NGS reads to a reference genome, generating an SAM file.

5. **Convert SAM to BAM Format (Using SAMtools):**
   ```bash
   samtools view -bS aligned.sam > aligned.bam
   ```
   Convert the SAM file to BAM format for easier manipulation and storage.

### Markdown Documentation:

Documentation is crucial when sharing your NGS code on GitHub. Use Markdown to create a well-structured README file:

# NGS Analysis

This repository contains code for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data analysis on a Linux platform.

## Installation

To run this code, you'll need the following prerequisites:

- Linux operating system
- BWA (Burrows-Wheeler Aligner)
- SAMtools
- And more

You can install the requirements using the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get install bwa
sudo apt-get install samtools
```

## Usage

To process and analyze your data, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your data directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/data
   ```

2. Align the data:
   ```bash
   bwa mem reference.fasta sample.fastq > aligned.sam
   ```

3. Convert the SAM file to BAM format:
   ```bash
   samtools view -bS aligned.sam > aligned.bam
   ```
